    <section name="About MMM Search::Engine">
      This project provides an API for indexing &#38; searching content
      as well as an implementation based on <a href="http://lucene.apache.org">lucene</a>.
      Implementations for other search-solutions like 
      <a href="http://egothor.org">egothor</a> are planned.<br/>
      This project has the following goals:
      <ul>
        <li>Easy integration of search-engine into your application.</li>
        <li>Standardized, fault-tolerant query-parser for independence from underlying 
        search-technology. This includes the ability to enable prefix-queries
        with lucene (e.g. <code>*foo</code>).</li>
        <li>Native query parser for advanced features.</li>
        <li>Standardized, extendable model for index structure.</li>
        <li>Paging of search results.</li>
        <li>Highlighting search results.</li>
      </ul>
      The trade-off is that you can only access features available via the API.
      If you want to use very specific lucene features you might want to use lucene directly.
